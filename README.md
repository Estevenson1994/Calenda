## Overview

A program that replicates the `cal` command on Linux and macOS machienes, that prints out a calendar to the console for the current month.

### How to get setup

To set up this program you will need to perform the following steps:

- Install Node.js on your machiene if it is not already installed. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Clone and download this repository `git clone https://github.com/Estevenson1994/command-line-calendar.git`

- Go into the project directory `cd command-line-calendar`

- Install dependencies using either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) by running `npm install` or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you have it installed, by running `yarn`. (If you don't have yarn installed you can install it by running `npm install yarn`)

### How to run

You can run this program by running `npm start` or `yarn start`.

### Additional comments

After one hour, this excercise has been completed up to printing out the calendar to the console, and bonus exercise: highlighting the current date. I didn't have time to go further within the hour.
